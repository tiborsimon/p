__projects__ is an easy to use _project navigator_ and a Makefile-like _scripting engine_. You can define your commands and inline documentations in __Projectfiles__.

It works on every _UNIX_ system with Python 2.7+ or 3.x installed. It's main purpose is to provide a simpler scripting interface with a built in documentation system. It's main target is any open source projects that want to be more user friendly from the first use. __projects__ designed to minimize the typing.

__projects__ is not a replacement for Makefile or CMake it is an optional wrapper for them.

## Features

- quick project navigation
- __Projectfile__ based recursive scripting system with _command concatenation_ and _recursive separation_
- instant help menu generation

## Installation

There are two possible way to install __projects__.

#### Install with pip

```
[sudo] pip install projects
```

#### Install from sources

1. download the latest release or clone the repo's master branch
1. go inside the sources root:
1. `[sudo] python setup.py install`

# Usage
```
p
p p
p <command>
p (-h|--help)
p (-v|--version)
p (-i|--init)
p (-w|--walk)
p (-l|--list) <command>
p (-md|--markdown) [<file_name>]
```


## Main command

```
p
```

This command is the main trigger for projects. It behaves differently depending on your current working directory.

_OUTSIDE_ your projects directory, it opens the project selector screen, where you can select your project by typing the projects name or by using the arrows keys.

_INSIDE_ any of your projects (inside the repository root directory) this command will show the manual generated from the __Projectfiles__.


## Direct project selector command

```
p p
```

This command behaves the same as the previous `p` command but it will always display the project selector screen. This could be handy if you want to switch projects quickly.

This is the only prohibited command name that you cannot use for your commands.

## Execute defined command

```
p <command>
```

This is the command for executing commands defined in the __Projectfiles__. By convention all defined command should start with an alphanumeric character. The commands started with a dash reserved for __projects__ itself.

The `<command>` keyword can be anything except the already taken keywords:

`p`, `-h`, `--help`, `-v`, `--version`, `-i`, `--init`, `-w`, `--walk`, `-l`, `--list`


## Help screen

```
p (-h|--help)
```

Brings up this help screen.

## Version information

```
p (-v|--version)
```

Prints out the current __projects__ version.

## Template Projectfile generation

```
p (-i|--init)
```

Generates a template __Projectfile__ into the current directory.

## Projectfile walk order listing

```
p (-w|--walk)
```

Lists out all directories in your project in the walk order __projects__ will follow. It marks the directories that contain a __Projectfile__.

## Processed command script listing

```
p (-l|--list) <command>
```

Lists out the processed command bodies for the given command.

## Markdown generation

```
p (-md|--markdown) [<file_name>]
```

Generates a Markdown file from your processed __Projectfiles__. You can optionally specify a name for teh generated file. The default name is README.md.


# Projectfile

__Projectfiles__ are the files you create in order to define commands that will be executed with the `p <command>`. __Projectfiles__ provide a powerful and self explanatory way to interact with your project.

You can create an example __Projectfile__ with the `p (-i|--init)` command. The generated __Projectfile__ will demonstrate all provided functionality except the recursive command concatenation since it will generate only one __Projectfile__.

There are mandatory and optional features you can add to __Projectfile__.

#### Mandatory

- __projects__ version
- at least one command definition header
- command body

#### Optional

- main description
- variables
- command alternatives
- command dependency list
- command description
- recursive separator

#### Feature order

There is a strict order where you can place each features. Between each feature arbitrary number of empty lines are allowed. The order is the following:

1. version
1. main description
1. variables
1. command header
1. command description
1. command body (pre, separator and post)


## Version

_mandatory_

```
v1.0.0
...
```

This feature will define the earliest version that is compatible with the used __Projectfile__ format. All __projects__ versions greater or equal to the defined one will be compatible with the format, but earlier versions may have problems with future features. The first release version is v1.0.0.

If there are more __Projectfiles__ in your project and the defined versions are different, the smallest version will be used to maximize the functionality.


## Main description

_optional_

```
...
"""
Description for the whole project.
"""
...
```

After the version you can define a global description of the whole project. You can write long lines, __projects__ will wrap them according to the defined `doc-width` key in the __~/.prc__ configuration file. Single line breaks won't break the lines in the generated manual. You have to use an empty line in order to add a line break.

If you have multiple __Projectfiles__ created, the main descriptions will be concatenated with empty lines according to the walk order.


## Variables

_optional_ 
 
```
...
variable = 42
other_variable = "This is a string with spaces"
yet_another_variable = Quotes are optional. This is still valid.
...
```

You can define variables as well. Each variable will be used as a string. No other variable format is currently supported. You can omit the quotes if you want, __projects__ will use the entire string you write after the `=` sign.

To use the variables you need to escape them:

```
$variable
${{variable}}
```

Both escapement is interpreted equally.

Defined variables go to the global variable pool. You cannot assign a variable the more than once. Hence you cannot redefine a variable in a later __Projectfile__ (a __Projectfile__ is the file that is processed later according to the walk order). Redefining a variable will raise an error. Since every variables go to the global variable pool, you can use the variables in any __Projectfile__ independently which __Projectfile__ you defined them. It is possible to use a variable in the root level __Projectfile__ that is defined in a later __Projectfile__.


## Command header

_mandatory_

```
...
my_command|alternative1|alt2: [dependency1, dependency2]
...
```

The command header feature allows you to define a command, it's alternatives and it's dependent other commands. The first keyword is the default keyword for the command. Alternatives are separated with the pipe `|` character. After the keyword definitions, a colon `:` closes the command header. After the colon, you can define a list of other commands, that are executed in the order you defined them before the current command execution.

According to the given example you can invoke your command with the following syntax inside your project directory:

`p my_command`
`p alternative1`
`p alt2`

Both will execute the same command body after the dependent commands (dependency1 and  dependency2) is executed first in the given order.

A command cannot be redefined in the same __Projectfile__ twice. If you redefine a command in another __Projectfile__, the commands' bodies will be appended to each other according to the path relationship of these files.


## Command description

_optional_

```
...
my_command:
  """
  This is a command description.
  """
...
```

The command description will be added to the generated manual. It behaves the same as the main description, except it requires an indentation in any way (space, tab, count doesn't matter).

If a command is redefined in another __Projectfile__, the command descriptions will be appended according to the path  relationship of these files.

## Command body

_mandatory_

```
...
my_command:
  command1
  command2
...  
```

The command body defines what commands __projects__ needs to execute if you invoke the given command with the `p <command>` syntax inside your project directory. Commands needs to be indented in any way (at least one space). __projects__ will execute all given commands line by line.


# Template Projectfile

The following __Projectfile__ can be generated with the `p (-i|--init)` command:

```
from v1.0.0

"""
This is a template Projectfile you have created with the 'p (-i|--init])' command.
You can use the provided commands 'hello' and 'answer' or it's shorter alternatives
'h' and 'ans' or 'a'. ie.: p <command>

You can start a new paragraph in the descriptions by inserting an empty line like this.

Descriptions are useful as they provide a searchable automatically generated manual
for your project for free. You can invoke this manual with the "p" command if you are 
inside your project directory.
"""

magic = 42  # variables goes to the global variable space

hello|h: [a]
    """
    This command will great you.

    There is a shorter alternative "h" for the command. It is depending on the
    "a" command which is the alternative of the "answer" command.

    If you execute a command with dependencies, it's dependencies will be executed first
    in the defined order.
    """
    echo "Hi! This is my very own Projectfile."

answer|ans|a:
    """
    This command will give you the answer for every question.

    You can use the long "answer" keyword as well as the shorter "ans" or "a" to
    execute this command.

    Inside the Projectfile, you can also refer to a command in another command's
    dependency list by any of it's alternatives.
    """
    echo "The answer for everything is $magic!" # you can also use the ${magic} form
```

If you use the `p` command inside your project's root directory, __projects__ will generate a _manual screen_ from the __Projectfiles__ you created. The previously listed __Projectfile__ will result the following _manual screen_ assuming that your project is called _example_ (the project name is picked from it's containing directory's name):

```
================================================================================
                                 E X A M P L E
================================================================================

 This is a template Projectfile you have created with the 'p (-i|--init])'
 command. You can use the provided commands 'hello' and 'answer' or it's
 shorter alternatives 'h' and 'ans' or 'a'. ie.: p <command>

 You can start a new paragraph in the descriptions by inserting an empty line
 like this.

 Descriptions are useful as they provide a searchable automatically generated
 manual for your project for free. You can invoke this manual with the "p"
 command if you are inside your project directory.


answer|ans|a:

    This command will give you the answer for every question.

    You can use the long "answer" keyword as well as the shorter "ans" or "a" to
    execute this command.

    Inside the Projectfile, you can also refer to a command in another command's
    dependency list by any of it's alternatives.


hello|h: [a]

    This command will great you.

    There is a shorter alternative "h" for the command. It is depending on the
    "a" command which is the alternative of the "answer" command.

    If you execute a command with dependencies, it's dependencies will be
    executed first in the defined order.
```

This manual is displayed in a pager, so you can exit with the `q` key.


# Advanced Projectfile examples

The following examples will demonstrate that __projects__ can handle multiple __Projectfiles__. It uses a strict alphabetical, hierarchical order (the _Projectfile walk order_). The first example will show you the __command concatenation__, and the second one will demonstrate the usage of the __recursive separator__.

## Simple example

If you have multiple __Projectfiles__ in your project and there are command headers that are defined in more than one __Projectfile__, the command bodies will be appended according to the path relationship of these files.

╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

#### What you can notice in this example

- You can use the `(-w|--walk)` and `(-l|--list)` commands to get information about the commands will be executed by __projects__.
- The command listing shows that the command bodies were concatenated according to the walk order (you can check with the `(-w|--walk)` command).
- The concatenated command list contains directory change commands (cd) so every command defined in a __Projectfile__ gets executed in the same directory level as it's __Projectfile's__ directory level.
- Thus the directory change commands, you can notice that each command will execute in the same execution context regardless of the command's length (number of lines). This is different than the Makefile conventions, and provide a much more simpler script writing.


## Using the recursive separator

There is another feature that can be used to execute post configuration eg. executing commands after all lower order command bodies were executed. This feature is called recursive separator (`===`). If you place this separator inside a command's body, and there are other lower level __Projectfiles__ in your project, the command bodies will be appended in a special, recursive order.

In a __Projectfile__, all commands before the separator are called the __pre__ commands, and all the commands after the separator are called the __post__ commands. The seprator in every command body is optional. If there is no separator, all the command lines in the command body will be handled as a __pre__ command block. Similarly if the command body starts with a separator the whole body will be used as a post block.

If there are no lower level __Projectfiles__, and you have a command with separated body, the sepration will be ignored.

If you have lower level __Projectfiles__, the base level pre commands will be executed first then the execution will jump to the lower level __Projectfile__. After the lower level __Projectfile's__ command script gets executed, the execution will be jump back after the base level separator, and the base post block will be executed.

If the lower level __Projectfile__ has separated command bodies, and there are yet another lower level __Projectfile__, the execution will jump down recursively until the last possible separation is executed.

The following example will demonstrate this behavior:

#### What you can notice in this example

- The recursive separators works as described. The post commands are executed after the pre commands for that level and all the recursive lower level other commands executed.
- Commands get executed in the same level where the __Projectfile__ they are defined in is located.
- Automatic directory changing command insertion is smart enough to insert only the absolute necessary directory changing commands. If there are no lower level commands, but the recursive separator exists, no directory changing will be inserted before the post commands. If there are no pre commands, no directory cahnging will be happen before the recursive separator content. Same goes to the post commands. If there are no post commands, no directory changing commands will be inserted after the recursive separator's content is executed.

TIP: You can always create a template __Projectfile__ with the `(-i|--init)` command.
